TITLE: Heart Disease Prediction
------------------------------------
In this Heart Disease Prediction Model, Based on patient's Medical attributes we perform analysis on patients
whether they are having Heart Disease or not....

Using Logistic Regression Algorithm
------------------------------------
One such supervised learning model that can be used is logistic regression that is used to model the probability of
a binary outcome such as the presence or absence of heart disease—based on input features. In this
article we will explore how Logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients.

DATASET : framingham.csv
---------
The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,
Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of
future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients information.
It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

STEP 1 :importing Necessary Libraries
--------
For this we will be importing Pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn library in python

STEP 2: Data Preparation
--------
2.1 Loading the dataset by using pd.read_csv

2.2 Then Handle the MissingValues by using the below
df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)  ======this removes any rows with missing values (NaN) from
the dataframe
df.TenYearCHD.value_counts()=========This prints the count of unique values in the TenYearCHD
column which likely indicates whether a patient has heart disease.

STEP 3 : Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
---------
Scaling is very important for many machine learning models,especially when the features have different
units of magnitudes.

Training set (70% of data,X_train and y_train)
Test set (30% of data,X_test and y_test)
random_state = 4 ensures the split is reproducible

STEP 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset
---------
In this section, we perform EDA on the heart disease dataset to understand
and gain insights into the dataset before building a predictive model for heart disease.

Ten Year’s CHD Record of all the patients available in the dataset:
sns.countplot(x='TenYearCHD', data=disease_df, palette="BuGn_r"): This creates a count plot using Seaborn.
It visualizes the distribution of the values in the TenYearCHD column showing how many individuals have
heart disease (1) vs. how many don’t (0).

STEP 5: Fitting Logistic Regression Model for Heart Disease Prediction
----------
model = LogisticRegression(): This creates an instance of the LogisticRegression model.

model.fit(X_train, y_train): This trains the logistic regression model using the training data
(X_train for features and y_train for the target).

y_prediction = model.predict(X_test): This uses the trained logistic regression model to make predictions
on the test set (X_test). The predicted values are stored in y_prediction.


STEP 6: Evaluating Logistic Regression Model
--------
Accuracy of the model is calculated by the function
accuracy_score(y_test,y_prediction)

Confusion Matrix
Confusion Matrix is a performance evaluation tool used to assess the accuracy of a classification model.
It is used to evaluate the performance of our logistic regression model in predicting heart disease helping
us understand how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative cases.

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_prediction): computes confusion matrix by comparing the actual values (y_test)
with the predicted values (y_prediction). It returns a 2×2 matrix showing true positives, true negatives,
false positives and false negatives.

Heart Disease Prediction Using Unsupervised machine Learning
---------------------------------------------------------------
generally less effective for predicting heart disease compared to supervised learning methods, which use
labeled data to train models to classify patients as having or not having heart disease.
